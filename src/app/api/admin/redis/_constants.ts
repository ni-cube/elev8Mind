What's been bothering you about your dad? Are you also feeling agitated, like you can't relax, or always on edge? | I am always agitated | It's understandable to feel that way. When you're constantly agitated, it can be really exhausting. Are you also experiencing feelings of irritability or hostility towards others? | I am irritated also | I hear you. It's tough to deal with constant irritation. Are you finding it hard to control your anger or feeling like everyone around you is annoying you? | you are right | Feeling sad, down, or blue can be really challenging. Are you experiencing these emotions frequently?",
